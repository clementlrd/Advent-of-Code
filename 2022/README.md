# Advent of code 2022

This is my code for the 2022 event.
You can find inputs in the `inputs/` folder.

## Run code

Challenges are written in Python thus require `python3`.
You can run the code with the following command (here the command for the day 1, you must follow the same pattern).

```bash
make d1 
```
